        <td>Anyvision has super advanced and accurate face recognition technology. As part of my role in the company, the team and myself, developed applications integrating with the company's face recognition technology, both on server and on stand
          alone device. We developed applications using MVVM, RxJava, Kotlin, DI (using koin framework), JNI integration, Android DataBinding and developed android libraries for reusability and the team efficiency. We also used CI to efficiently run
          tests as part of the development process. Unfortunately my great experince with Anyvision came to an end due to CO-VID19 unfortunate situation.</td>
